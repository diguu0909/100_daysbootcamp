If you want, I can also help you write a *fancier* README where we add:
- A project image (screenshot)
- A live demo link (if you host it)
- Some badges (like "Built with Python" badge)

**Would you like me to help you make a more advanced README too?**  
(Only if you want to make it look even cooler!)
